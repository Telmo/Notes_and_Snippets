SSH is a protocol for authenticating and encrypting remote shell sessions.

But, using SSH for just remote shell sessions ignores 90% of what it can do.

```
# ssh home -L 80:reddit.com:80
```

This article covers less common SSH use cases, such as:

- using passwordless, key-based login;
- setting up local per-host configurations;
- exporting a local service through a firewall;
- accessing a remote service through a firewall;
- setting up a SOCKS proxy for Firefox;
- executing commands remotely from scripts;
- transfering files to/from remote machines;
- mounting a filesystem through SSH; and
- triggering admin scripts from a phone.

## Why SSH?
As recently as a 2001, it was not uncommon to log in to a remote Unix system using telnet.

Telnet is just above netcat in protocol sophistication, which means that passwords were sent in the clear.

As wifi proliferated, telnet went from security nuissance to security disaster.

As an undergrad, I remember running ethereal (now wireshark) in the school commons area, snagging about a dozen root passwords in an hour.

SSH, which encrypts and authenticates connections, had been in development since 1995, but it seemed to become adopted nearly universally and almost overnight around 2002.

It is worth configuring SSH properly:

- per-user configuration is in `~/.ssh/config`;
- system-wide client configuration is in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`.
- system-wide daemon configurtion is in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

## Key-based, passwordless authentication

Key-based passwordless authentication makes it less cumbersome for other programs and scripts to piggyback atop SSH, since you won't have to re-enter your password each time.

Key-based authentication exploits public-key cryptography to prove to the server that the client owns the secret private key without revealing the key.

If you're curious about public-key cryptography, see my post on a [short implementation of RSA](http://matt.might.net/articles/implementation-of-rsa-public-key-cryptography-algorithm-in-scheme-dialect-of-lisp/).

To set this up, first log in to the client machine.

Then create a private/public key pair with ssh-keygen:
```
 $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
```

This will place the private key in ~/.ssh/id_dsa and the public key in `~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub`.

Guard the private key (set appropriate permissions) as if the private key were your password. In effect, it is.

Now, append the contents of `~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub` to the end of `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine.

For example:
```
 $ cat .ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh host 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```
(On Linux systems, you can use ssh-copy-id instead; the technique above is more portable.)

Do not copy your private key over.

Now, when you connect to that account, it won't require a password.

## Executing remote commands
To run a command on a remote system without logging in, specify the command after the login information:

 $ ssh host command
For example, to check remote disk space:

```
 $ ssh host df
```

My favorite example for Linux is piping the microphone from one machine to the speakers of another:

```
 $ dd if=/dev/dsp | ssh -C user@host dd of=/dev/dsp
 ```

## Copying files with ssh
For copying data and files over SSH, there are a few options.

It's possible to copy with the command cat. If you're trying to copy the output of a process instead of a file, this is certainly a reasonable route.

If you're going to use SSH like this, disable the escape sequences:

```
 $ cat file | ssh -e none remote-host 'cat > file'
```

If these are going to be large files, you may want to use the -C flag to enable compression.

For copying files, the program scp works like cp, except it also accepts remote destinations.

For example:
```
 $ scp .bash_profile matt@example.com:~/.bash_profile
```

For an FTP-like interface for copying files, use the program sftp.

## Per-host SSH client configuration options
You can set per-host configuration options in ~/.ssh/config by specifying Host hostname, followed by host-specific options.

It is possible to set the private key and the user (among many other settings) on a per-host basis.

Here's an example config file:
```
Host my-server.com
User admin
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/admin.id_dsa
BatchMode yes
EscapeChar none

Host mm
User matt
HostName might.net
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/matt.id_dsa

Host *.lab.ucaprica.edu
User u8193
```

The first example enables batch mode, which means it will never ask for a passphrase or password for this host. It also disables an escape sequence, which avoids any hiccups when transmitting arbitrary data. If ssh is to be invoked within scripts, this is a good option.

The second example uses a HostName abbreviation, so that ssh mm is equivalent to `ssh -i ~/.ssh/matt.id_dsa matt@might.net`.

The third example sets the user to u8193 for any machine in the subdomain lab.ucaprica.edu.

See more options in man ssh_config.

## Configuring sshd
The options most frequently tweaked are:

`Port`: set this to the port on which you want sshd to run. Unless you have a compelling reason to move it, keep it on 22.
`PermitRootLogin`: set this to no and then configure sudo to add a little security; another good setting is without-password, which will force the use of public key authentication for root.
`PasswordAuthentication`: set this to no to disallow password authentication entirely and to require public key authentication.
The man page for sshd_config summarizes the remaining options well.

## Local port forwarding
SSH allows secure port forwarding.

For example, suppose you want to connect from client A to server B but route traffic securely through server C.

From A, run:
```
$ ssh C -L localport:B:remoteport
```

Then, to connect to B:remoteport, connect to localhost:localport.

If you use add -g, then anyone that can reach A may connect to B:remoteport through A:localport.

This is useful for evading firewalls.

For example, suppose your work banned reddit.com.

Run this:
```
# ssh yourserver -L 80:reddit.com:80
```

And, set the address of reddit.com and www.reddit.com to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts.

You will also need to disable any local web server running first.

Now, it will surreptitiously traffic to reddit.com through your yourserver.

If you do this frequently, you might want to add a special host:

```
 Host redditfw
 HostName yourserver
 LocalForward 80 reddit.com:80
```

## Remote port forwarding

Alternatively, suppose you wanted to give remote machine B access to another machine, A, by passing securely through your local machine C.

Then, on C, you can run:

```
 $ ssh B -R remoteport:A:targetport
```

At this point, local users on B can connect to A:targetport through localhost:remoteport.

If you want to to allow nonlocal users to be able to connect A:targetport through localhost:remoteport, then set:

```
 GatewayPorts yes
```
in the sshd_config file.

Once again, if you do this frequently, set up a special host in ~/.ssh/config:
```
 Host exportme
 HostName B
 RemoteForward remoteport A:targetport
```

## Setting up a SOCKS proxy for Firefox
SSH can also set up a SOCKS proxy to evade a firewall.

It's remarkably simple:

```
 $ ssh -D localport host
```
In Firefox, under Preferences > Advanced > Network, select "Settings."

Set your SOCKS5 proxy to localhost port localport.

Test it out by googling "what is my ip."

Firefox will now forward your web traffic through host.

A word of caution: this will not forward your DNS requests.

If you need to hide your DNS requests as well, I recommend installing DNSCrypt from OpenDNS.

In `about:config`, you can also tell Firefox to forward your DNS requests; set:

`network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to true.

## SSH as a filesystem: sshfs
Using the FUSE project with sshfs, it's possible to mount a remote filesystem over SSH.

On the Mac, use Fuse4x.

From HomeBrew, install it all with:
```
 $ brew install sshfs
 ```
And, once it's installed, run:
```
 $ sshfs remote-host: local-mount-directory
```
 
## SSH from windows
Sometimes, you need to get to your home machine from windows. In these cases, you want the PuTTY suite of tools.

## SSH from iOS
Using SSH from iOS can be cumbersome, but the iSSH app is particularly well-suited to administrative tasks.

The iSSH app allows storing configurations, which enables per-machine private keys and remote commands to run upon connecting.

So, you can create a configuration that logs in to run a shell script.

I have three command-based configurations for might.net:

- a script to (re)start the web server;
- a script to (re)start the DNS server;
- a script to reboot the entire server.
